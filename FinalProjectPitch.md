# TLVulkanRenderer
A simple Vulkan-based renderer for my [master thesis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YOAv2D23j74bExjP2MCMmDOQPquy9ywhBTW-tgU2QXA/edit?usp=sharing) on real-time transparency.

The renderer will be a rasterizer the implements [phenomenological transparency](http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/papers/TransparencyI3D16/McGuire2016Transparency.pdf) to demonstrate how the GPU could map well to this algorithm for real-time transparency.

This project also documents my learning progress with Vulkan and GPU programming.

### Nov 4, 2016 - Memory & Depth Image

| Normal | Depth | Lambert |

#### Memory management

In order to achieve cache ultilization and limit the amount of costly memory allocation, I packed the vertex indices and vertex attributes data for each mesh into the same `VkDeviceMemory` allocation and the same `VkBuffer`, and leaving the uniform buffer in its own `VkDeviceMemory` since it's being updated every frame. This helps reduce the initialization time to load each scene since we no longer have to create a new `VkBuffer` and allocate a new `VkDeviceMemoy` for each attribute.

Instead of directly map memory from the host, I create a temporary buffer for staging and transfer the data onto device memory this way.

![](TLVulkanRenderer/images/charts/Vulkan_memory_layout.png)

In this layout scheme, we still need to partition based on each mesh data because when the meshes are extracted from glTF, each of them have their unique buffer view that needs to be handled properly. It seems to me that it's possible that we can just directly copy this glTF's buffer view into `VkDeviceMemory` and offset the `VkBuffer` correctly from there. It's also possibl to resuse the same `VkDeviceMemory` for different `VkBuffer`, but it seems quite error-prone to me to go down that path.  

More details can be found at [Vulkan Memory Management](https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-memory-management) from NVIDIA.

#### Depth buffer

![](TLVulkanRenderer/images/head_depth.png)

The depth buffer in Vulkan is represented using a [`VkImage`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/xhtml/vkspec.html#resources-images). It's a type of resource that the framebuffer uses to store its data. Similarly to the [`VkImage`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/xhtml/vkspec.html#resources-images)s inside the swapchain, a depth image is just another attachment to the renderpass. However, depth image still has to be created as an additional resource that we need to manage. I allocated a screen size depth resource for populating the depth data in, and then attache the depth image to the renderpass's subpass (I only use one subpass). 

After that, the graphics pipeline creation needs to be modified to enable the depth and stentil stage by setting [VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/xhtml/vkspec.html#VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo) struct and set its pointer to the graphics pipeline.

### Oct 21, 2016 - This time is for glTF!

[Duck](TLVulkanRenderer/scenes/Duck) mesh in glTF format (partially complete, shading hasn't been implemented properly)! 

Right now I was able to load the index data and vertex data. I'm working on merging all the vertex buffers required for position, normal, texcoord attributes, indices, and uniforms, into a single buffer or memory allocation as recommended in the [Vulkan Memory Management](https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-memory-management) blog by Chris Hebert ([@chrisjebert1973](https://github.com/chrisjebert1973)) and Christoph Kubisch.
